# Computer Networking Research: Analysis of Delay Tolerant Networks

Code from internship at UC Santa Cruz. Edited existing code for Spray and Wait, AODV, etc. to run simulations for Delay Tolerant Networks, comparing their performance with various parameters and analyzing which networks would be best in different types of emergencies.
